Once pulled files can be one of the three states :
  - updated : The file has been updated because someone else pushed a newer version
  - auto-merged : The file was modified and has been merged with someone else's changes  
  - conflicted : The file has been modified and some lines are in conflict with someone else's changes. You should fix the conflicts and push your changes
