## ks backup

Creates a backup of your local secrets and files.

### Synopsis

Creates a backup of your local secrets and files.

Since we do not keep a copy of your secrets or files on our servers, 
it can be useful to regularly back them up to a secure location
to prevent losing them all if anything were to happen to your device.
